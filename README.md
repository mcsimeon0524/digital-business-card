# What is this project?

This project is my first react project. It is a digital business card based on the [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact/section-1-solo-project-coce646e88eea46f91af43ca4) course that is for free.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Problems faced

At first, I had difficulty in making the components align together. Some are overlapping with the others, and some are shorter than the others. What I did is to set the width to a fixed size, and adjusted any small overlaps by changing the padding of the component.

I also had problems with the footer especially the icons that I downloaded. I had to change the color through photoshop in order for it to complement the background and be more visible to the eye.
