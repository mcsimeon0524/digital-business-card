# digital-business-card
My first react project. A digital business card. This is based on the Scrimba project course. 
I built this from scratch marking this as my very first react project

# Built with:
* React
* HTML5
* CSS Grid

# Problems faced
At first, I had a problem with the padding and such because it kept going all over the place and won't work with the other components
I solved it by setting the width into a single width and changed the padding just to compensate the extra spaces that are overflowing

I also wanted to add a feature which is the transition feature. At first, I just did the color change when you hover it
but it did not look good, so I added a transition and transform just to have some sort of responsiveness to the website.

# Lesson learned
* I learned more about how components work in React and how they work together in order to make a good webpage
* I also learned more css tricks and techniques in order to design a good looking website
